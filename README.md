## 🌲 About The Game

This game was developed in about a day as an extra credit assignment for my Game and Simulation Design class. Comes equipped with the original sprites, sounds, and difficulty of the original.

## 📈 Status
This game is on hold for now but someday I may add the finishing touch which is making the bird rotate like it did in the original.
